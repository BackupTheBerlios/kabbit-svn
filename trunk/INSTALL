---- kabbit install instructions ----

kabbit depends on python and the python xmpppy module. Before you install kabbit,
you have to make sure that both are installed.

If you use debian, you can install both with:

 apt-get install python python-xmpp


For other distributions have a look at your own paket-management tool or fetch the software from
http://www.python.org and http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net .


Then go to your kabbit-source folder and run ./install.py.
